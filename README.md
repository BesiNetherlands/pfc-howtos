Also you will find a version information that show exactly the firmware version on which this
Howto was created. This means if you will find an older HowTo for a newer firmware it might 
require a little extra effort to transfer it to the actual firmware version.
Pleasw keep in mind that some HowTos includes a precompiled package. Those could work on older versions but we recommend to recompile them within the actual firmware.

A version Information looks like this:


---
**HowTo XY - For Version BSP2017.17.1**

---

Inside the HowTo directory you will find for older HowTos a **HowTo_XY.txt** file. This file contains a setup guide and provides some extra informations.
